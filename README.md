# `wxpy-rofi-config`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thecjharries/wxpy-rofi-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thecjharries/wxpy-rofi-config) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/thecjharries/wxpy-rofi-config/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/thecjharries/wxpy-rofi-config)

I've got a few goals with this project:

1. Test out `wxPython >=4.0`
2. Learn wxWidgets basics
3. Provide a GUI for `rofi` config

At the moment, I'm able to

* load `rofi`'s default and current configs
* provide a tabbed interface with settings
* include inline documentation
* save a rudimentary config file in an easy location
