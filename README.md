# `wxpy-rofi-config`

I've got a few goals with this project:

1. Test out `wxPython >=4.0`
2. Learn wxWidgets basics
3. Provide a GUI for `rofi` config

At the moment, I'm able to

* load `rofi`'s default and current configs
* provide a tabbed interface with settings
* include inline documentation
* save a rudimentary config file in an easy location
